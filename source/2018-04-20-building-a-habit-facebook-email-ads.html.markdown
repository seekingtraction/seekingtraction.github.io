All right we're about two weeks into the product hunt launch so we have a bunch of new users that are on the site using it regularly. The thing we're trying to do, and we should have done this earlier, but we're trying to make sure MightyScout is top of mind with these new users. So when someone uses a brand new tool or new website they can very easily forget about it the same day or within just a few hours because it's not a habit yet. So that's why there's a lot of activation emails and different emails that people send which we've also been doing.

I think we want to try to get at least like three emails and within the first seven days and then getting some ads in as well would be great and the ads are mostly just retargeting so that when people are browsing you know their Twitter feeds and Facebook feeds they still have MightyScout top-of-mind so they're aware that our tool exists to hopefully get them to use the site a few more times to where it becomes more of a habit.

What's really cool with like social networking sites and things like that is you can have reactivation emails when people like your stuff or comments you have these natural behaviors where you want to come back and use the product with sass it more feels like you need to really get attached to the workflow so when someone thinks hey I need to find an influencer or I need to
understand their stats they think MightyScout so we are trying to really own that mind space but it's something that is difficult to do very early on since the product is new.
