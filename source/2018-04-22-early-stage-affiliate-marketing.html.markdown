Hey all welcome to another episode of Seeking Traction so after the launch someone posted about MightyScout in an
Italian Facebook group: 

![Facebook group post of MightyScout](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/seeking-traction/ep3-fbgroup.png)

and that led to a lot of different Italian users signing up. And one person who's also Italian, ended up messaging us 

![Intro email reaching out to help](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/seeking-traction/ep3-intro-email.png)

turns out that he has built courses for growing your Instagram following and has a community specifically around Instagram along with an email list. So we started talking about doing things like an affiliate marketing type setup and having him talk to these Italian specific leads in Italian and we can use like a custom email there.

We're gonna need to create a referral link so that anything that he posts online we can credit to him and then also we're gonna need to do a demo and education on the nuances of the platform so that he's talking about making like content online that talks about the product and how to use it. But we'll see how it goes and if you have any questions be sure to leave them in the comments and I'll see you next time.
