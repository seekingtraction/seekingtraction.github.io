All right here's the first episode of Seeking Traction, we're gonna go over MightyScout a product I've been working on for a little bit more than a year and our launch on the Product Hunt about a week ago.

At this time we were just getting all the images together and just trying to get this thing out the door there are just so many things going on with the last-minute changes and fixes the website but yeah here we go.

So now the site's live and I mean it's huge relief but we start running into issues with I didn't know that there is
supposed to be a description, there's all sorts of stuff on the right side that needs to be filled out I wasn't aware that we needed any of this stuff

and then the biggest thing is the gif that we had prepared is just too big so you could see how I was like blurry even as people are starting off a product

so I'm just scrambling trying to find a way to display this thing in a much better format so I'm like using [Kippur] [cisors] and all sorts of different things and just like really trying to figure out how can we minimize the size to show it in its best light and ultimately I'm just playing around with all these image settings and I end up putting up an image for the time being and then I had to reshoot an entire little clip that was small enough to be around like three megabytes so that they can load fairly decently on the site but yeah huge relief
